# Plant Disease Classifier

## Overview

The Plant Disease Classifier is a deep learning project that classifies plant images into three categories: Rusty, Powdery, or Healthy. The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a dataset from Kaggle. Users can upload an image of their plant through a user-friendly interface built with Gradio, which will then provide the classification.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled images of plants categorized as Rusty, Powdery, or Healthy.
